# Binary Search Tree Viewer
Binary search tree visualizer which allows users to add, remove and clear nodes from the tree, as well as visualize different traversal algorithms. This project was built using C# Windows Forms and SVGs to render the visual representation of the tree. The binary search tree data structure is widely used in computer science and this tool can help users to better understand its behavior and operations in an intuitive way.
